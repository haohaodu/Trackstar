COMP 3004: Mobile App Group Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSPjW4BXQ3Q&amp;feature=youtu.be

## About 

This project was made throughout the Winter term of 2020 by a team of 4 Carleton University Computer Science students. Trackstar is a mobile student productivity application that aims to help keep students on track, combining familiar tools such as calendars, grade calculators, and reminders into one super app. 

Our team has implemented bonus features such as user estimation accuracy's which indicate how much a user tends to overestimate or underestimate their task completion time based on previous completion rates. A customized task prioritizer that automatically prioritizes the tasks inputted based on estimated duration time, due date, and weighting. And many more features to come ! 

Check out a live demo through the video above or clone our repo to try it out yourself !
